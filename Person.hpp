For example, one event by Alice (red) records the fact that Bob performed a gossip sync in which he sent her everything he
 knew. This event is created by Alice and signed by her, and contains the hashes of two other events: her last event and Bobâ€™s 
 last event prior to that gossip sync. The red event can also contain a payload of any transactions that Alice
 chooses to create at that moment, and perhaps a timestamp which is the time and date that Alice claims to have created it.
